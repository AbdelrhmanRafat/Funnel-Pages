/**
 * ClassicThemeFormFields.ts
 * 
 * This file handles the form functionality for the Classic Theme.
 * It includes form validation, submission, and other interactive features.
 */

// NOTE: The <script> tag in ClassicThemeFormFields.astro which handles similar client-side
// interactions (like payment option selection and form submission alerts) is currently commented out.
// This TypeScript file provides more robust form validation. If this .ts file is used as the primary
// source for form logic, ensure there's no conflicting or redundant JavaScript in the .astro file.

// Initializes form field functionalities, primarily setting up validation.
