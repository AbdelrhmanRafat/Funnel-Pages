/*
This TypeScript file is intended for client-side JavaScript functionalities
associated with the nasaThemeProduct.astro component.

Currently, this file is empty, suggesting that the product page's interactivity
is handled either directly within the .astro file's <script> tags or by other
more specific TypeScript files (e.g., for the gallery or purchase options).

If more complex client-side logic is needed for the overall product page,
such as advanced event handling, data manipulation, or dynamic content updates
not covered by sub-components, it can be added here.

For example:
- Initializing third-party libraries specific to the product page.
- Handling complex form submissions or interactions.
- Managing state that affects multiple parts of the product display.

// Example of a function that could be exported and used:
/*
export function initProductPageAnalytics() {
  // Logic for product page analytics
  console.log("Product page analytics initialized.");
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // initProductPageAnalytics();
});
*/
